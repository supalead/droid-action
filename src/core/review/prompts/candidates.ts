/**
 * Platform-agnostic Pass 1 (candidate generation) prompt.
 *
 * Both `src/create-prompt/templates/review-candidates-prompt.ts` (GitHub)
 * and `src/gitlab/prompts/candidates.ts` (GitLab) delegate to this builder
 * via thin adapters that supply a `ReviewTerminology` object plus the
 * runtime context (entity number, SHAs, artifact paths). The /review skill
 * itself is platform-agnostic; this builder produces the runtime harness
 * (where to read inputs, where to write the candidates JSON, what NOT to
 * call) around it.
 *
 * STRICT contract: this prompt MUST NOT instruct the model to call any
 * posting tool. Posting is Pass 2's responsibility, and tool gating is
 * additionally enforced at the `droid exec` level via `--enabled-tools`.

## Security Review (run concurrently)

In addition to the code review, you MUST also spawn a \`security-reviewer\` subagent via the Task tool.
This subagent runs **concurrently** with the code review subagents during Step 2.

Spawn it with:
- \`subagent_type\`: "security-reviewer"
- \`description\`: "Security review"
- \`prompt\`: Include the full ${t.entityNoun} context (${t.repoLabel.toLowerCase()}, ${t.entityNoun} ${t.metaEntityNumberKey === "prNumber" ? "number" : "IID"}, head SHA, ${t.baseRefShortLabel}) and the paths to precomputed data files (diff, description, existing comments). The security-reviewer will invoke the security-review skill and return a JSON array of security findings.

**IMPORTANT**: Spawn the security-reviewer in the SAME response as the code review subagents so they all run in parallel.

After all subagents complete (both code review and security-reviewer), merge the security findings into the \`comments\` array alongside code review findings. Security findings use the same schema but are prefixed with \`[security]\` in their body (e.g., \`[P1] [security] Title\`).

  return `You are a senior staff software engineer and expert code reviewer.

- **version**: Always \`1\`

- **meta**: Metadata object
  - \`${t.metaRepoKey}\`: "${repoOrProject}"
  - \`${t.metaEntityNumberKey}\`: ${entityNumber}
  - \`headSha\`: "${headSha}"
  - \`${t.metaBaseRefKey}\`: "${baseRef}"

  - \`path\`: ${t.pathFieldDescription}
${bodyFieldDescription}
  - \`line\`: ${t.lineFieldDescription}
  - \`startLine\`: \`null\` for single-line comments, or start line number for multi-line comments
${sideFieldDescription}
  - \`commit_id\`: "${headSha}"

- **reviewSummary**: Object with **exactly** these two keys — \`body\` and \`verdict\`:
  - \`body\`: 1-3 sentence overall assessment
  - \`verdict\`: Either \`"CLEAN"\` or \`"FINDINGS"\`. Set \`"CLEAN"\` ONLY when there are no actionable issues anywhere — the \`comments\` array is empty AND you raised no concern in \`body\`. If you describe **any** issue only in \`body\` (a summary-only concern with no inline comment), the verdict MUST be \`"FINDINGS"\`. Any non-empty \`comments\` array is also \`"FINDINGS"\`.
